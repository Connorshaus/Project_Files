Test Groups 

Group 1:
-- Pipeline without data or control hazards 

Group 2:
-- Data hazards solvable by forwarding
 * lw -> sw, alu -> sw
 * alu -> alu, lw -> alu
 * hazards on $0
 * redundant hazards, 
 * two consecutive hazards

Group 3: 
-- Data hazards requiring stalls

Group 4: 
-- Control hazards forward and backword

Notes:
-- Address false negatives (missed forwards/stalls)
-- Address false positives (incorrect forwards/stalls)
